# CSBackup

With this tool you can backup your files and folders and even Microsoft sql server databases.

You can backup thousands files and the files can be very big (more than 2 gigabytes).

The application can upload the backup file to a ftp server of your choice.

The application was written originally in vb6 and then translated to vb.net.

I am working to translate the application from vb.net to c# and then get this tool running on Mono.
